# What's this

Collection of hooks that we re-use at Jam3

# Why?

Since the React landscape is changing with the introduction of hooks
and the "deprecation" of classes is useful for us to keep a collection
of hooks so we can share functionality between projects.

You could face 3 cases

1. The functionality that you need is already here so just `npm install`
2. There is some missing functionality so you want to make the hook
   dynamic to multiple cases well open a PR
3. Your use case is too specific, just copy and paste the hook and adapt it these way at least you're not starting from 0 and with best practices

# Installation

```bash
npm i react-hooks-lab
```

```jsx
// Import depending what you need it will tree-shake the modules
import { useIntersectionObserver } from "react-hooks-lab";
import { useMousePosition } from "react-hooks-lab";
import { useScrollDirection } from "react-hooks-lab";
import { useScrollProgress } from "react-hooks-lab";
import { useScrollToTop } from "react-hooks-lab";
import { useWindowSize } from "react-hooks-lab";
```
